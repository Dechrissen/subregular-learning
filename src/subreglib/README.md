# subreglib

This directory is populated by the `.plebby` files for use with `plebby` which is included in [The Language Toolkit](https://github.com/vvulpes0/Language-Toolkit-2) by Dakotah Lambert.  These files are generated by the Python script `generate-subreglib.py` in the parent directory.

## `.plebby` files

Currently, these files uses three varying alphabet sizes (4, 16, 64) and three different *k*-values (2, 4, 6). There is one `.plebby` file per language, plus three defining the alphabets. There are 1623 total `.plebby` files. They are named according to the scheme `Sigma.Tau.class.k.t.i.plebby`, where `Sigma` is a two-digit alphabet size, `Tau` a two-digit number of salient symbols, `class` the named subregular class, `k` the width of factors used (if applicable), `t` the threshold counted to (if applicable), and `i` a unique identifier.

Each of these files can be used with `plebby` to generate the `.att` files for each language (some of which already exist in `/src/fstlib/att_format`).
